      <p class="card-text">Data is the primary driver of the digital economy and the world’s most valuable commodity. While it is well understood how to capture and store data from Internet-connected sources, processing it is less clear—lots of data goes to waste. One data set which is particularly difficult to process is geolocation data (a set of GPS coordinates of a user device as it moves through space). Enter GeoPredict, a machine learning model I developed using Pandas during my time as a research associate at Western University. GeoPredict mines value from massive sets of geolocation data collected on a continuous basis by applying A.I techniques from the field of natural language processing. </p>

    <p class="card-text">Once I finished my summer research effort (GeoPredict) I wondered how to deploy the model into a production environment and make it scale. What I came up with is a framework for deploying scalable recommender systems built on Spark SQL as web-accessible microservices. Through the use of containerization, the implementation of a restFULL API and sophisticated integrated command-line tooling, I designed this framework to be highly usable, portable, customizable and interoperable. The framework is meant to allow data scientist to focus on building ML models using  instead of worrying about managing clusters and dealing with pesky configuration.</p>
