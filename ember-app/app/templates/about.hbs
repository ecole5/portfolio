            <p>How does it work and how can it work better? This has been the passion from the moment I first turned on my first computer.</p>

<p>From machine learning, to cluster computing, to microprocessor architecture I am on a quest to satisfy my intellectual curiosity and push the boundaries of what is possible.</p>

<p>On the way, I relish in learning from and empowering my peers through instante collborarion. I particularly enjoy communicating my work in forums big and small- from my technical blog to presenting on stage I am thrilled.</p>

<p>While I am highley technical I am also pragmatic. I obsess over solutions that bring value and drive business goals. For as much as a like to obsess over transistor sized details I like to look at stars and see the big picture. </p>

<p>While I am passionate about technology I bring my passionate nature to all my other downtime pursuits. Health and fitness, DIY and general adventure just to name a few. </p>
